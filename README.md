# text_classification
The repository consists of a simple model to perform text classification using a very simple algorithm that is entirely based on conditional probability: Naive Bayes. To be precise the algorithm used here is "MultinomialNB". 

# Motivation
There are vaious methods of classification including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc. But, a very simple but powerful algorithm also exists: Naive Bayes. This algorithm is based on an assumption of independence between the features. When independence assumption is to be overruled then the model is converted into a Bayesian Network which works with a very less amount of data. 


# Libraries Used
sklearn  
numpy 
matplotlib
seaborn

In order to install the above packages using pip, use command $pip install package-name

# Usage
Run the jupyter notebook Text_classification_Naive_Bayes.ipynb
